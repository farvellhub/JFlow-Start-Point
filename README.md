# JFlow Start Point

My own library for animation, state control and bundle purposes. Light and modern frontend tooltip with all you need for start!


# Characteristics.

· `Webpack5` as bundler.

· `image post-procesing`.

· `post-css` as SASS transpiler.

· `babel7` as ES7 transpiler.


# Where to start.

Download the `.zip` and extract it to your project folder.

Run these scripts at the root directory.

    - npm install
    - npm run dev // We have problems with webpack serve

The last command above starts a webpack live server.

Run `npm run-script build` to run development build. You can also run `npm run build-prod` for production environment.


# Directories

· `/public/build`: Webpack bundle.

· `/src/api`: Js modules.

· `/src/styles`: Scss classes.

Feel free to use it. :)
